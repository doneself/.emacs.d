This package provides a simple way to customize dired mode to
display files in different faces and colors. Faces are chosen based
on file extension, file name, or a regexp that matches the whole
file line.

Screenshots are available at [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/Diredful#toc4][EmacsWiki]].

* Install

Put this file in your Emacs-Lisp load path, and add the following
into your $HOME/.emacs startup file.

: (require 'diredful)

* Usage

Do:

: M-x diredful-add

This will ask you to define a new name for a file type, like
"images". You can then specify a list of extensions and file names
that belong to this type, and customize the face that will be
used to display them. A new face will be automatically generated
and updated for each type.

Note: changes will only be applied to newly created dired
buffers.

File Types can be added, edited, and deleted using any of the
following three commands:

: M-x diredful-add
: M-x diredful-delete
: M-x diredful-edit

These settings will be saved to the location of
=diredful-init-file= (the default location is
"~/.emacs.d/diredful-conf.el"). You may choose a different location
by doing:

: M-x customize-variable <ENTER> diredful-init-file

* Tips

File type names are sorted alphabetically before being
applied. If two file types matched the same file, the
file type that comes last in an alphabetically-sorted list will
take precedence (e.g., a type named "zworldwritable" will take
priority over other file types).

The world-writable regexp pattern used in the screenshot is =[rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-][rwx-]w[trwx-]=.
